                <p>
                    Hello. I am Reid VanDiepen. I am a 2nd year Game Design and Development major at RIT. I love
                    playing and making
                    video games, creating videos, and weight training. My goal is to work at a game studio, big or
                    small, on games I
                    am interested in and passionate about. I hope to be able to create memorable experiences through
                    media I create,
                    whether it be games or something else. If I could choose a studio, I would probably pick either
                    Bungie or Hopoo
                    Games. For this class, I hope to be able to create a professional portfolio so I can present my
                    work to
                    employers or peers, as well as learn some JavaScript. I have worked with web hosting sites
                    before, but I only have a bit of experience writing directly in HTML and CSS, and I hope
                    learning this will improve my overall web design skills.
                </p>
